- 👋 Hi, I’m @MarkVZephyrus
- 👀 I’m interested in game development in C++ and thus Unreal.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning a lot. Am a beginner, and thus I wonder why you are interested in me.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on discussion about a place that could offer me excellent education in game dev(prefferably for free, yes I'm a miser).
- 📫 How to reach me? Don't.
