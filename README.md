<H1> This is Mayank Kashyap. </H1>
<h2> What I do [and don't]</h2>
<p fontsize >C++ noob.<br>
C# novice.<br>
Java 0.01%.<br>
Game development mostly but actually I enjoy any coding.<br>
Except Python. Don't get me started on that one. I hate it. Kinda ironic then, that my most active and invested in repositories are coded in python.
Well like I said, don't get me started.<br>
Also no databases please. And no Web.</p>

<H2>Repositories</H2>
I have been lately. So there's only 2 repositories where once there were 5 (not including the GitHub repo of course)<br>
<h4>HMS_SchoolProject:</h4> School project.
<H4>BasicPlayer:</h4> My tinkering with C# and WPF.

<h2>PS stuff [idk]</h2>
<p>I am a student. Circumstances have slowed my effort to learn,<br>
But I mean to catch up once the situations are favourable.</p>
