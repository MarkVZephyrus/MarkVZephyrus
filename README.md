<H1> This is Mayank Kashyap</H1>
<h2> What I do [and don't]</h2>
<p fontsize >C++ noob.<br>
C# novice.<br>
Java 0.01%.<br>
Game development mostly but actually I enjoy any coding.<br>
Except Python. Don't get me started on that one. I hate it. Kinda ironic then, that 2 of my repositories are coded in python.
Well like I said, don't get me started.<br>
Also no databases please. And no Web.</p>

<h2>PS stuff [idk]</h2>
<p>I am a student. Circumstances have slowed my effort to learn,<br>
But I mean to catch up once the situations are favourable.</p>
